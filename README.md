# Detecting-AI-Generated-Images
Generative AI models like DALLÂ·E, Midjourney, and StyleGAN2 can now create hyper-realistic synthetic images, posing major risks such as misinformation, identity fraud, copyright violations, and erosion of public trust. Without reliable automated detection, these images spread unchecked across digital platforms.
The project implements a Hybrid CNN-Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for detecting AI
generated images with high accuracy, combining the strengths of convolutional neural networks for
 local feature extraction and vision transformers for global pattern recognition
